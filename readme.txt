Creative Feature: Full Meal Builder + Delivery & Receipt Enhancements

To enhance user experience and simulate a more realistic ordering system, I implemented a multi-part creative upgrade:

1. Full Meal Upgrade
Users can build a full meal by adding extras like:
- Sides (e.g. Fries, Chicken Wings)
- Toppings (e.g. Onions, Bacon)
- Drinks (e.g. Cola, Juice)
- Dips and Desserts
The system accepts extras by name (case-insensitive) and shows prices for each.

2. Smart Delivery System
- Users can choose between Takeout or Delivery
- If Delivery is selected, they enter their address, postcode, and email
- The app saves this info and offers to reuse it next time (no retyping needed)

3. Receipt Generation
- A detailed receipt is printed for each order
- Shows pizza type, order type (box/slice), quantity, extras selected, total price, discount (if any), and delivery details
- If delivery, the receipt also shows the user's postcode and confirms that an email was sent

Why I Chose This Feature:
I chose to add these features to make the ordering system feel more complete and easy to use. I wanted users to be able to customize their order without stress, and to handle common tasks like choosing extras or entering delivery details in a smooth, friendly way. Reusing saved delivery info also saves time and effort, especially for returning customers. Overall, my goal was to improve convenience, flexibility, and the overall user experience. In the future, I plan to implement delivery fees based on the distance between the customer's address and the pizzeria. To promote larger orders, I also intend to offer free delivery for orders that exceed a certain price threshold. This feature will add more realism and flexibility to the system, mimicking how real-world delivery services work.

How to Access These Features:
- After choosing a pizza, say y or yes to upgrade your order to a full meal
- Add any extras you like (press Enter to skip a category)
- When asked, choose T for takeout or D for delivery
- Enter your address/postcode/email on first use; next time, you can reuse them
- Your receipt will include all selections and pricing details
